<p>MongoDB version: <strong>5.0.9+</strong> - Date: <strong>June 2022</strong></p>
<h1 id="main-concepts">Main concepts</h1>
<p><span class="concept">Document</span> : A record in MongoDB is a document, which is a data structure composed of field and value pairs. MongoDB documents are <strong>very</strong> similar to JSON objects. Values may include other documents, arrays, and arrays of documents.</p>
<pre><code>{
    name: &quot;John&quot;,
    age: 77,
    nets: [ &quot;expert&quot;, &quot;developer&quot;, &quot;superhero&quot; ],
    lastExp: { name: &quot;Full-Stack Lead Developer&quot;, duration: 10.5 }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note : each document requires a unique <span class="concept">_id</span> field (uses the ObjectId BSON type) that acts as a primary key. The MongoDB driver generates it if omitted.</p>
<p><span class="concept">Collection</span> : A grouping of MongoDB documents. A collection is the equivalent of an RDBMS table. Collections do not enforce a schema by default. Documents within a collection can have different fields but should have a similar or related purpose. </p>
<h1 id="bson-types">BSON types</h1>
<p>Each value of a field/value pair is recorded as a BSON type. BSON is a binary serialization format. The most used and useful BSON types in MongoDB are (each BSON type has both integer and string identifiers) :</p>
<p><strong>Double</strong> : 1 &quot;double&quot; ; <strong>String</strong> : 2 &quot;string&quot; ; <strong>Object</strong> : 3 &quot;object&quot; ; <strong>Array</strong> : 4 &quot;array&quot; ; <strong>ObjectId</strong> : 7 &quot;objectId&quot; ; <strong>Boolean</strong> : 8 &quot;bool&quot; ; <strong>Date</strong> : 9 &quot;date&quot; ; <strong>Null</strong> : 10 &quot;null&quot; ; <strong>32-bit integer</strong> : 16 &quot;int&quot; ; <strong>64-bit integer</strong> : 18 &quot;long&quot; ; <strong>Decimal128</strong> : 19 &quot;decimal&quot;</p>
<p>Note : <strong>Timestamp</strong> data type is for internal MongoDB use. You will want to use the BSON date type.</p>
<h1 id="time-series-collections">Time series collections</h1>
<p>Time series collections came with version 5.0 of MongoDB. They efficiently store sequences of measurements over a period of time. Time series data is any data that is collected over time and is uniquely identified by one or more unchanging parameters. Consider using them for measurements storage !</p>
