<h1 id="main-concepts">Main concepts</h1>
<p><span class="concept">Quality Gates</span> : Set of boolean conditions based on measure thresholds 
<strong>against which projects are measured during a period</strong>. </p>
<pre><code>Blocker Issues equals 0
Code Coverage is greater than 80%
</code></pre>
<p><span class="concept">Rules</span>: rules are executed on source to generate issues. Three basic types of rules: <strong>Reliability</strong>, <strong>Maintainability</strong> and <strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>Rule definition:</p>

<ul>
<li>Language</li>
<li>Type: bug, vulnerability, code smell</li>
<li>Tag</li>
<li>Repository</li>
<li>Status: beta, deprecated, ready</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;.equals()&quot; should not be used to test the values of &quot;Atomic&quot; classes
Language: Java
Type: bug
Tag: multi-threading
Repository: N/A
Status: ready
</code></pre>
<p><span class="concept">Quality profiles</span> : Collections of rules to apply during an analysis.
Each language has a default profile</p>
<p><span class="concept">Metric</span> : A type of measurement. Examples: number of lines of code, number of duplicated blocks, complexity etc.</p>
<p><span class="concept">Reliability</span> : code that can produce operational risks or unexpected behavior at runtime. Must of time it&#39;s the consequence of lack of compliance with best practice </p>
